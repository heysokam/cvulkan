## ?.?.? - Support for Tile-Based GPUs
Really low priority before v1.0.0.  
The user could create their own `cvk_***_create` functions  
and still use most of cvulkan's API as normal.  

```md
## Static Rendering: Renderpass
- `src/cvulkan/rendering/renderpass.c` and `src/cvulkan/rendering/renderpass.h`
- [ ] **RenderPass setup**
  - [ ] Fully Customizable Options (for Tile-Based GPUs)
  - [ ] Subpass Setup
  - [ ] Dependency Configuration
```


## ?.?.? - ?????
All of these tasks feel like random slob generated by the LLM.  
Will review the list for 1.0.0, in case there is something salvageable.
