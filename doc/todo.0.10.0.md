## 0.10.0 - Buffers
**Goal**: Buffer creation and operations, GPU Memory creation.

```md
# Data
## Buffer
- [x] Creation: Customizable
- [x] Bind
- [x] Copy
  - [x] Buffer to Buffer
## Memory
- [x] Creation: Customizable
```

```md
- `src/cvulkan/data/buffer.c`
- [x] **Review buffer creation and management**
  - [x] Verify buffer creation
  - [x] Check buffer memory binding
  - [x] Test buffer data operations (copy, bind)
```

```md
- `src/cvulkan/data/memory.c`
- [ ] **Review memory operations**
  - [ ] Verify memory allocation patterns
  - [ ] Check memory binding validation
  - [ ] Test memory mapping operations
  - [ ] Ensure proper memory cleanup
```

```md
- [ ] **Create comprehensive buffer example**
  - [ ] Example with vertex buffer creation
  - [ ] Example with uniform buffer creation
  - [ ] Example with staging buffer operations
  - [ ] Example with buffer data transfer
```

```md
- [ ] **Documentation updates**
  - [ ] Update data.h documentation about Buffers and Memory
  - [ ] Add buffer management examples
```
